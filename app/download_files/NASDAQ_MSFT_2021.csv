BUSINESS  
GENERAL  
Embracing Our Future  
Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to 
achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms 
and tools help drive  small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public -sector efficiency. They also 
support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.  
We bring technology and products together into experiences an d solutions that unlock value for our customers. Our 
ecosystem of customers and partners has stepped up to help people and organizations in every country use technology to 
be resilient and transform during the most trying of circumstances. Amid rapid chang e we’ve witnessed technology 
empower telehealth, remote manufacturing, and new ways of working from home and serving customers. These 
capabilities have relied on the public cloud, which is built on the investments we have made over time.  
We are living in the new era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge, which is being sharpened by rapid advances in 
distributed computing, ambient intelligence, and multidevice experiences. This means the places we go and the things we 
interact with will increasingly  become digitized, creating new opportunities and new breakthroughs. In the next phase of 
innovation, computing is more powerful and ubiquitous from the cloud to the edge. Artificial intelligence (―AI‖) capabilities  
are rapidly advancing, fueled by data an d knowledge of the world. Physical and virtual worlds are coming together with 
the Internet of Things (―IoT‖) and mixed reality to create richer experiences that understand the context surrounding 
people, the things they use, the places they go, and their activities and relationships. A person’s experience with 
technology spans a multitude of devices and has become increasingly more natural and multi -sensory with voice, ink, and 
gaze interactions.  
What We Offer  
Founded in 1975, we develop and support soft ware, services, devices, and solutions that deliver new value for customers 
and help people and businesses realize their full potential.  ","A description of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements can be found in our filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K."

Industry Trends  
Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each 
industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologi es, or new ideas that can further transform the 
industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research 
and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of custo mers and users, industry 
trends, and competitive forces.  
Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks  
The markets for software, devices, and cloud -based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are 
developing new software and devices, w hile also deploying competing cloud -based services for consumers and 
businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in 
the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of clou d-based services to use. We must continue to evolve 
and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure 
and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our opera ting margins.  
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and 
industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, 
broad customer  reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, 
and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to 
global macroeconomic and geopol itical factors, which remain dynamic.  
Our devices are primarily manufactured by third -party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components 
for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near -term flexibility to use other 
manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at 
these suppliers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.  
Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and 
expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may 
significa ntly affect revenue and expenses. Weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies increased 
reported revenue and did not have a material impact on reported expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 
2021.  
Refer to Risk F actors in our fiscal year 2021 Form 10 -K for a discussion of these factors and other risks.  
COVID -19  
In fiscal year 2021, the COVID -19 pandemic continued to impact our business operations and financial results. Cloud 
usage and demand benefited as customers accelerate their digital transformation priorities. Our consumer businesses 
also benefited from the remote environment, with continued demand for PCs and productivity tools, as well as strong 
engagement across our Gaming platform. We saw improvement in customer advertising spend and savings in operating 
expenses related to COVID -19, but experienced weakn ess in transactional licensing. The COVID -19 pandemic may 
continue to impact our business operations and financial operating results, and there is uncertainty in the nature and 
degree of its continued effects over time. Refer to Risk Factors in our fiscal year 2021 Form 10 -K for a discussion of these 
factors and other risks.  ","We have filed our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 with the Securities and Exchange Commission."
3,"We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; 
enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of 
derivatives that a re not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.  
Interest and dividends income decreased due to lower yields on fixed -income securities. Interest expense decreased due 
to a decrease in outstanding long -term debt due to debt maturities. Net recognized gains on investments increased due to 
higher gains on equity securities. Net gains on derivatives decreased due to lower gains on foreign currency contracts.  
INCOME TAXES  
Effective Tax Rate  
Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was 14% and 17%, respectively.  The decrease in our effective ta x 
rate was primarily due to tax benefits from a decision by the India Supreme Court on withholding taxes in the case of 
Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax, an agreement between 
the U.S. and India tax  authorities related to transfer pricing, final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (―TCJA‖) regulations, and an 
increase in tax benefits relating to stock -based compensation.  
We have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withh olding and tax audit 
assessments in India. In March 2021, the India Supreme Court ruled favorably for companies in 86 separate appeals, 
some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a  
party to the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, we 
recorded a net income tax benefit of $620  million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India 
Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016.  
Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in 
foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing ou r products and services through our foreign regional 
operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, tax benefits relating to stock -based compensation, and tax benefits from 
the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes.  
The mix of income before in come taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result 
of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2021, our U.S. 
income before income taxes was $35.0  billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.1  billion. In fiscal year 
2020, our U.S. income before income taxes was $24.1  billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 
$28.9  billion.  
Uncertain Tax Positions  
We settled a portion of the Int ernal Revenue Service (―IRS‖) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In 
February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to  ","We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit."

FINANCIAL CONDITION  
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments  
Cash, cash equivalents, and short -term investments totaled $130.3  billion and $136.5  billion as of June  30, 2021 and 
2020. Equity investments were $6.0  billion and $3.0  billion as of June  30, 2021 and 2020, respecti vely. Our short -term 
investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly 
liquid investment -grade fixed -income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investm ents are 
predominantly U.S. dollar -denominated securities, but also include foreign currency -denominated securities to diversify 
risk. Our fixed -income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of 
our fixed -income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed -income indices. The 
settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short -term investments held are primarily highly 
liquid inves tment -grade fixed -income securities.  ","As of June 30, 2021, our assets were $130.3 billion."
5,"44 fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level  
below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an e vent occurs or 
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. 
These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating 
perfo rmance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of  
assets and liabilities to re porting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of 
each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow 
methodology. This analysis requires  significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent 
on internal forecasts, estimation of the long -term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which 
cash flows will occur, and determination of o ur weighted average cost of capital.  
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, 
market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the 
determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  
Research and Development Costs  
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until 
technological feasibil ity has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs 
are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when 
technological feasibility of a  product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software 
products is reached after all high -risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this 
occurs shortly before the products are rel eased to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of 
revenue over the estimated life of the products.  
Legal and Other Contingencies       
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant unc ertainty. An estimated loss 
from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an 
asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimat ed. In 
determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an 
unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could 
materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  
Income Taxes  
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current 
year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an 
entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more 
likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authori ties, based on the technical 
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on 
the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. A ccounting literature 
also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets 
and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures . Judgment is 
required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial 
statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our 
conso lidated financial statements.  
The TCJA significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. Refer to 
Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.  ",Goodwill impairment Goodwill impairment is a measure of the fair value of an asset or liability relative to its carrying value.

7,"47 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
RISKS  
We are exposed to economic risk from foreign  exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use 
derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.  
Foreign Currencies  
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and l iabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign 
currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. 
Principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese yen, Britis h pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.  
Interest Rate  
Securities held in our fixed -income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We 
manage the average maturity of the fixed -income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global 
fixed -income ind ices.  
Credit  
Our fixed -income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment -grade securities. We manage credit 
exposures relative to broad -based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification.  
Equity  
Securities held in our equity i nvestments portfolio are subject to price risk.

9,"53 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
Accounting Principles  
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America (―GAAP‖).  
We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period pr esentation. The recast of these prior 
period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated 
cash flows statements.  
Principles of Consolidation  
The consolidated financial statements include the ac counts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany 
transactions and balances have been eliminated.  
Estimates and Assumptions  
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue 
recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone 
selling price (―SSP‖) o f performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and 
refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible 
assets for our reporting units; p roduct life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful 
accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock -based compensation forfeiture rates; when 
technological feasibility is achieved for our prod ucts; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been 
recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments 
for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from mana gement’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and 
uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to COVID -19.  
In July 2020, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment and determined w e 
should increase the estimated useful life of server equipment from three years to four years and increase the estimated 
useful life of network equipment from two years to four years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning 
fiscal year 2021. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net 
as of June  30, 2020, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2021 was an increase in operating income of 
$2.7 billion and net income of  $2.3 billion, or $0.30 per both basic and diluted share.  
Foreign Currencies  
Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. 
Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments 
resulting from this pr ocess are recorded to other comprehensive income.  
Revenue  
Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue  
Product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross -device productivity applications, server applications, 
business solution applications, d esktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and 
hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.  ","Financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 are preliminary and subject to change at any time."

11,"NOTE 5 — DERIVATIVES  
We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to 
enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include 
reducing, eli minating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our 
derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  
Foreign Currencies  
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign 
currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.  ",The following table lists our derivative and foreign currency exposures.
12,"65   
Foreign currency risks relate d to certain non -U.S. dollar -denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange 
forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro -
denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchang e forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging 
instruments.  
In the past, option and forward contracts were used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue and were 
designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies  hedged included the Euro, Japanese yen, British 
pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.  
Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign 
exchange rates on certain balance sheet a mounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.  
Interest Rate  
Interest rate risks related to certain fixed -rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value 
hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed intere st rates to floating interest rates.  
Securities held in our fixed -income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We 
manage the average maturity of our fixed -income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correl ate to certain broad -
based fixed -income indices using exchange -traded option and futures contracts and over -the-counter swap and option 
contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in ―Other contracts‖ in the tables  
below.  
Equity  
Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.  At times, we may hold options, futures, 
and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in ―Other contract s‖ in 
the tables below.  
Credit  
Our fixed -income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment -grade securities. We use credit default swap 
contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad -based indices and to facilitate portfolio di versification. These 
contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in ―Other contracts‖ in the tables below.  
Credit -Risk -Related Contingent Features  
Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisio ns that require our issued and 
outstanding long -term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum 
liquidity of $1.0  billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post co llateral, similar to 
the standard convention related to over -the-counter derivatives. As of June  30, 2021, our long -term unsecured debt rating 
was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0  billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be poste d.  ","Risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following:"

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan an d 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was 
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial 
reporting, assess ing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered 
necessary in the circumstances. We believe tha t our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and 
procedures that  (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit prep aration of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3)  provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.  
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control ov er financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compl iance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Projections
This Annual Report on Form 10-K and oral statements made from time to time by representatives of the
Company may contain or incorporate by reference certain statements that are “forward-looking statements” within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Reform Act”). Generally, forward-looking
statements include the words “may,” “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “estimate,” “goal,”
“upcoming,” “outlook,” “guidance” or the negation thereof, or similar expressions. In addition, all statements that
address future operating, financial or business performance, strategies or initiatives, future efficiencies or savings,
anticipated costs or charges, future capitalization, anticipated impacts of recent or pending investments or transactions
and statements expressing general views about future results or brand health are forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are based on our expectations at the time such
statements are made, speak only as of the dates they are made and are susceptible to a number of risks, uncertainties
and other factors. For all of our forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-
looking statements contained in the Reform Act. Our actual results, performance and achievements may differ
materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by our forward-looking
statements. Many important factors could affect our future results and cause those results to differ materially from
those expressed in or implied by our forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the
following:
 the disruption to our business from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the impact of the
pandemic on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects;
 the impact of competition or poor customer experiences at Wendy’s restaurants;
 economic disruptions, including in regions with a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants;
 changes in discretionary consumer spending and consumer tastes and preferences;
 impacts to our corporate reputation or the value and perception of our brand;
 the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs and new product development;
 our ability to manage the accelerated impact of social media;

In addition to the factors described above, there are risks associated with our predominantly franchised business
model that could impact our results, performance and achievements. Such risks include our ability to identify, attract
and retain experienced and qualified franchisees and effectively manage the transfer of restaurants between and among
franchisees, the business and financial health of franchisees, the ability of franchisees to meet their royalty, advertising,
development, reimaging and other commitments, participation by franchisees in brand strategies and the fact that
franchisees are independent third parties that own, operate and are responsible for overseeing the operations of their
restaurants. Our predominantly franchised business model may also impact the ability of the Wendy’s system to
effectively respond and adapt to market changes. Many of these risks have been or in the future may be heightened
due to the business disruption and impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.
All future written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are
expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to above. New risks and
uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us. We
assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as
a result of new information, future events or developments, except as required by federal securities laws, although we
may do so from time to time. We do not endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by
third parties.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we
have included below certain material factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and
could cause our actual consolidated results during fiscal 2021, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in
or implied by any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.
Risks Related to Macroeconomic and Industry Conditions
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt our business,
which has materially affected and could continue to materially affect our results of operations, financial condition and
prospects for an extended period of time.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a global
pandemic, and governmental authorities around the world implemented measures to reduce the spread of
COVID-19. These measures adversely affected customers, workforces, economies and financial markets, and, along
with decreased consumer spending, led to an economic downturn in many of our markets. Governmental restrictions
and public perceptions of the risks associated with COVID-19 have caused consumers to avoid or limit travel,
gatherings in public places and other social interactions, which has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely
affect, our business.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, we updated our brand standard to include the
closure of all dining rooms except where there were specific needs, or a drive-thru or pick-up window option was not
available, subject to applicable federal, state and local requirements. Substantially all Wendy’s restaurants continued to
offer drive-thru and delivery service to our customers. During the second quarter of 2020, we began implementing
our restaurant and dining room reopening process through a phased approach in accordance with federal, state and
local requirements, with customer and team member safety as our top priority. Dining rooms have been re-opening at
each restaurant owner’s discretion, subject to applicable regulatory restrictions. As of January 3, 2021, approximately
75% of dining rooms were open across the Wendy’s system offering carryout and, in some cases, dine in services. The
COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in the temporary closure of certain restaurants across the Wendy’s system. As
of January 3, 2021, more than 99% of our global systemwide restaurants were operating.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our customer counts and systemwide sales have been significantly
negatively impacted. Even as mobility continues to increase, customers have been and may continue to be reluctant to
return to in-restaurant dining, and consumer spending may continue to be adversely impacted for an extended period
of time as a result of decreased consumer confidence and the impact of lost wages due to increased unemployment.
During the fourth quarter and full year of 2020, global same-restaurant sales increased 4.7% and 1.2%, respectively,
primarily driven by the positive impact of our new breakfast daypart in the United States and higher average check,
partially offset by a decline in customer counts.
The COVID-19 pandemic has also adversely affected new restaurant development and restaurant reimaging.
Due to the uncertain and challenging economic and market conditions, we delayed construction of certain new
Company-operated restaurants and reimaging of existing Company-operated restaurants and also extended the new
restaurant development and Image Activation requirements of our franchisees by one year. These delays could affect
our ability to drive future growth in our business.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on our
franchisees’ operations and financial condition. Following the onset of the pandemic, we took certain actions to
support our franchisees, including extending payment terms for royalties, extending or abating payment terms for
advertising fund contributions and offering to defer base rent payments on properties owned by the Company and
leased to franchisees. To the extent our franchisees experience financial distress, including as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, it could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition through
delayed or reduced payments of royalties, advertising fund contributions or rent.
13",The Wendy’s Company
4,"The COVID-19 pandemic led, and could again lead, to interruptions in the delivery of food or other supplies
to Wendy’s restaurants arising from delays or restrictions on shipping or manufacturing, closures of supplier or
distributor facilities or financial distress or insolvency of suppliers or distributors. These delays or interruptions could
impact the availability of certain food items at Wendy’s restaurants, including beef, chicken, pork and other core
menu products. For example, we experienced disruptions to our beef supply beginning in early May 2020 as beef
suppliers across North America faced production challenges. As a result, some menu items were occasionally in short
supply at some Wendy’s system restaurants. While we and our supply chain partners effectively managed through this
disruption and the beef supply subsequently returned to normal levels across the Wendy’s system, there can be no
assurances that we will not see similar disruptions in the future. Our results of operations and those of our franchisees
could be adversely affected if our key suppliers or distributors are unable to fulfill their responsibilities and we are
unable to identify alternative suppliers or distributors in a timely manner or effectively transition the impacted
business to new suppliers or distributors.
The COVID-19 pandemic could also lead to labor shortages or increased labor costs. The risk or perceived risk
of contracting the virus could adversely affect the ability or cost of adequately staffing restaurants, which could be
exacerbated to the extent that the Company or franchisees have employees who test positive for the virus. If a
significant percentage of our or our franchisees’ workforce is unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine,
travel limitations or other governmental actions or restrictions, our operations and the operations of our franchisees
may be negatively impacted, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. We took
several actions to help support our employees and protect the health and safety of our employees and customers, such
as implementing a new emergency sick leave policy, providing temporary wage increases to restaurant employees and
purchasing additional sanitation supplies and personal protective materials, which contributed to increased operating
costs.
The impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital
resources. We currently believe we have the ability to pursue additional sources of liquidity if needed or desired to
fund operating cash requirements or for other purposes. However, there can be no assurance that additional liquidity
will be readily available or available on terms acceptable to us. If the disruptions caused by COVID-19 worsen, our
ability to comply with certain debt covenants under our securitized financing facility could be adversely affected.
Additionally, negative changes to our credit ratings due to the impact or expected impact of COVID-19 could have
an adverse effect on our existing indebtedness, our ability to access additional capital, our cost of borrowing and our
overall liquidity position and financial condition.
In addition to the risks described above, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, the
effect of heightening other risks disclosed in this risk factors section, including, but not limited to, risks related to
competition, economic conditions and disruptions, brand value and perception, consumer preferences and spending,
commodity costs, labor, supply chain and purchasing, new restaurant development and reimaging, performance of the
breakfast daypart, franchisees, leasing and ownership of real estate, international operations, digital commerce and
technology, cybersecurity, our securitized financing facility and levels of indebtedness, complaints or litigation, legal
and regulatory requirements, impairment charges and payment of future dividends. We cannot predict the ultimate
duration, scope or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or its ultimate impact on our results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.
Competition from other restaurant companies, as well as grocery chains and other retail food outlets, or poor customer
experience at Wendy’s restaurants, could hurt our brand.
The market segments in which Wendy’s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among
other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience, and the nature and condition of the
restaurant facility. If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy’s restaurant, whether at a Company-operated or
franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in customer counts. Further, Wendy’s restaurants compete with a
variety of locally owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional, national and global restaurant chains. Several of
these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends.
Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost value meal menu options and have employed
marketing strategies that include frequent use of price discounting (including through the use of coupons and other
offers), frequent promotions and heavy advertising expenditures. Some of our competitors have substantially greater
financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing

5,"country-by-country basis by the first person to obtain protection through use or registration in that country in
connection with specific products or services. Some countries’ laws do not protect unregistered trademarks at all, or
make them more difficult to enforce, and third parties have filed, or may in the future file, for “Wendy’s” or similar
marks. Accordingly, we may not be able to adequately protect the Wendy’s brand everywhere in the world and use of
the Wendy’s brand may result in liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution or unfair competition. In
addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws
of the United States. We cannot ensure that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the
United States and foreign countries will be adequate.
We cannot ensure that third parties will not bring infringement claims against us in the future. Any such claim,
whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly
modifications to advertising and promotional materials, harm our brand, image, competitive position or ability to
expand our operations into other jurisdictions, cause us to incur significant costs related to defense or settlement or
require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could harm our business and
adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, third parties may assert that certain of
our intellectual property, or our rights therein, are invalid or unenforceable. If our rights in any of our intellectual
property were found to infringe third-party rights, or portions thereof were deemed invalid or unenforceable, we may
be forced to defend or resolve related claims and incur related expenses. In addition, such loss of rights could permit
competing uses of such intellectual property which, in turn, could harm our business and adversely impact our results
of operations and financial condition.
Food safety events or health concerns regarding our products could create negative publicity and adversely affect our
brand, business and results of operations.
Food safety is a top priority for Wendy’s, and we dedicate substantial resources to food safety matters to ensure
our customers enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness
(such as salmonella or E. coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. Food
safety events, whether or not involving Wendy’s restaurants or other restaurant companies, could adversely affect the
price and availability of certain products and result in negative publicity for Wendy’s or the restaurant industry. This
negative publicity may reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in customer counts to
Wendy’s restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types. Any
report linking our restaurants or suppliers to food-borne illnesses or food tampering, contamination, mislabeling or
other food-safety issues could damage the value of our brand immediately and severely hurt sales of our products and
possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or other damages. The Wendy’s system
may also be adversely impacted by consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of the products we sell, the
ingredients in our products or the cooking processes used in our restaurants. These or similar concerns could result in
less demand for our products and a decline in sales at Company-operated restaurants and in royalties from sales at
franchised restaurants.
Risks Related to Our Business Strategy
Our predominantly franchised business model presents a number of risks.
As of January 3, 2021, approximately 95% of restaurants in the Wendy’s system were operated by franchisees.
Wendy’s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth
in our franchise and other agreements with them. Wendy’s also provides training and support to franchisees.
However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and franchisees own, operate and oversee
the daily operations of their restaurants. Specifically, franchisees are solely responsible for developing and utilizing
their own policies and procedures, making their own hiring, firing and disciplinary decisions, scheduling hours and
establishing wages, and managing their day-to-day employment processes and procedures, all of which is done
independent of Wendy’s and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules or regulations. Further, franchisees have
discretion as to the prices charged to customers. As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise
restaurant rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate their restaurants in a manner consistent
with required standards, their royalty payments to us could be adversely affected and our brand’s image and
reputation could be harmed, both of which in turn could hurt our business and results of operations. In addition, the
failure of franchisees to adequately engage in succession planning may adversely affect their restaurant operations and
development of new Wendy’s restaurants, which in turn could hurt our business and results of operations.
17","Wendy’s International, Inc., The Wendy’s Company, and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Wendy’s” or the “Company”), including, but not limited to, the trademarks “Wendy’s,” the “Wendy’s” logo, the “Wendy’s Value Menu,” the"
6,"Image Activation program. If franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all,
they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants or the development of new
restaurants, and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, or successfully implement other
strategic initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results.
We continue to optimize the Wendy’s system through our system optimization initiative, which includes
facilitating the transfer of restaurants between and among franchisees, as well as evaluating strategic acquisitions of
franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees, to
further strengthen the franchisee base, drive new restaurant development and accelerate adoption of our Image
Activation program. The success of this initiative is dependent upon many factors, such as the availability of sellers
and buyers, the availability of financing, the ability to negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable and the
ability to successfully transition and integrate restaurant operations. Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various
risks to our operations, including (i) diversion of management’s attention to the integration of acquired restaurant
operations; (ii) increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating
efficiencies; (iii) exposure to liabilities arising out of prior operations of acquired restaurants; and (iv) the assumption
of long-term, non-cancelable leases. Our system optimization initiative places demands on our operational and
financial management resources and may require us to expand these resources. If we are unable to execute our system
optimization initiative or effectively manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, our business and financial
results could be adversely affected.
In addition, Wendy’s from time to time evaluates and may pursue other opportunities for growth through new
and existing franchise partners, joint venture investments, expansion of our brand through other opportunities and
strategic mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. These strategic initiatives involve various inherent risks, including,
without limitation, general business risk, integration and synergy risk, market acceptance risk and risks associated with
the potential distraction of management. Strategic transactions may not ultimately create value for us or our
stockholders and may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.
Our leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses, including
liabilities associated with environmental matters.
We have significant real estate operations in connection with our business and are subject to all of the risks
associated with leasing and owning real estate. Our real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate
operations are impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in the investment climate for real estate,
macroeconomic trends, governmental regulations, insurance, demographic trends, supply and demand for the
ownership and operation of restaurants and environmental matters. A significant change in real estate values, or an
increase in costs as result of any of these factors, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial
condition.
We are subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the
discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental laws provide
for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of
the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Third parties
may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage
associated with releases of or exposure to such substances. A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations
or are adjacent to current or former gas stations or were used for other commercial activities that can create
environmental impacts. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties and we
may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such
liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation,
fines or clean-up responsibilities. We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order
to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims.
We generally secure long-term real estate interests for our leased restaurants and have limited flexibility to
quickly alter our real estate portfolio. Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the
19","Wendy’s risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:"
7,"lease and any renewals of the term. Most leases require us to pay the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and
utilities. We generally cannot cancel these leases prior to the expiration of their term. If an existing or future restaurant
is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the
applicable lease including, among other things, paying rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each lease
expires, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at
all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations, negatively impacting our results of operations.
The breakfast daypart is competitive across the restaurant industry and we may be unable to achieve or maintain
market share or reach targeted levels of breakfast sales and profits.
Wendy’s entered the breakfast daypart across the U.S. system in March 2020. The Company and franchisee
leadership worked closely to align on a breakfast program designed to drive incremental sales and profits through a
strong economic model. However, we may be unable to achieve market share and reach targeted levels of breakfast
sales and profits due to competitive pressures and responses from our competitors, some of whom are well-established
in the breakfast daypart, or other factors, including operational complexity, food and labor costs, lack of consumer
acceptance, discretionary spending patterns that differ from other dayparts and changes to customer mobility and
daily routines, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, breakfast sales could cannibalize sales
during other parts of the day and may have negative impacts on restaurant margins. The continued active support and
engagement of our franchisees is also critical for the successful performance of the breakfast daypart. The breakfast
daypart may require significant financial resources, including the Company’s plans to fund incremental marketing
and advertising campaigns. Our inability to successfully execute on our strategy for the breakfast daypart could have a
material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our international operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that our
international operations will be profitable.
In addition to many of the factors described in this risk factors section, our business outside of the United
States is subject to a number of additional factors, including international economic and political conditions, risk of
corruption and violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, the inability to
adapt to differing cultures or consumer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure within foreign countries to
support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product
specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, challenges and risks associated with managing and
monitoring suppliers, restrictions on our ability to move cash out of certain foreign countries, currency regulations
and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and
obligations in connection with international franchise agreements, the collection of royalties and other fees from
international franchisees, the inability to protect technology, data or intellectual property rights, compliance with
international privacy and information security laws and regulations, the availability and cost of land, construction
costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development or operation of new restaurants and the
inability to identify, attract and retain experienced management, qualified franchisees and joint venture partners.
Adverse conditions or unforeseen events in countries that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants
(including Canada, our largest international market), could have a material adverse impact on our international
growth strategy and results of operations. In addition, to the extent we invest in international Company-operated
restaurants or joint ventures, we would also have the risk of operating losses related to those restaurants, which could
adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that our international
growth strategy will be successful or that our international operations will be profitable.
As previously announced, Wendy’s intends to open Company-operated restaurants in the United Kingdom
and, if successful, plans to expand into other anchor markets in Europe utilizing a franchise model. New markets may
have low brand awareness as well as competitive conditions, consumer tastes, discretionary spending patterns and
social and cultural differences that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets. We may need to
make greater investments than we originally planned in advertising and promotional activity to build brand
awareness, which could negatively impact the profitability of our operations. In addition, we may be unable to obtain
desirable locations for new restaurants at reasonable prices, or at all, and restaurants may have higher construction,
occupancy, food and labor costs than we currently anticipate. Moreover, geopolitical risks, including the United
Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, may result in increased regulatory complexities and economic
20","Wendy’s is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause its results of operations and financial condition to be adversely affected, including but not limited to:"
8,"uncertainty. Any of these risks and uncertainties, and other factors we cannot anticipate, could have a material adverse
impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Risks Related to Supply Chain and Labor
Changes in commodity costs and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.
Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs
(including beef, chicken, pork, cheese and grains), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs.
Increases in commodity costs, particularly beef or chicken prices, could adversely affect our future results of
operations. Our business is susceptible to increases in commodity and other operating costs as a result of various
factors beyond our control, such as weather conditions and patterns, demand, food safety concerns, product recalls,
federal ethanol policy, fuel costs and government regulations. Significant increases in expenses incurred by consumers,
such as living expenses or gasoline prices, could also result in decreased customer counts at our restaurants, which
could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing
commodity costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect
our results of operations. In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers. If
increased costs were passed to our customers, demand for our products may decrease, which in turn could adversely
affect our results of operations.
Shortages or interruptions in the supply or distribution of perishable food products could damage our brand and
adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Wendy’s and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand
specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand,
problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, political unrest, health epidemics or
pandemics, inclement weather or other calamities or conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost
of ingredients, which could lower revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm
our business and the businesses of our franchisees. Certain of the products sold in our restaurants, such as beef and
chicken, are sourced from a limited number of suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. In
addition, our system relies on a limited number of in-line distributors to deliver certain food, packaging and beverage
products to our restaurants. If a disruption of service from any of our key suppliers or distributors was to occur, we
could experience short-term increases in our costs while supply and distribution channels were adjusted, and we may
be unable to identify or negotiate with new suppliers or distributors on terms that are commercially reasonable to us.
As discussed above, the COVID-19 pandemic led, and could again lead, to delays or interruptions in the delivery of
food or other supplies to Wendy’s restaurants, which could impact the availability and cost of certain food items at
Wendy’s restaurants.
We do not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for our restaurant system, which could harm our business, results
of operations and financial condition.
While we require and seek to ensure that all suppliers to the Wendy’s system meet certain quality control
standards, our franchisees ultimately control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other
operating supplies from third party suppliers through QSCC, Wendy’s independent purchasing co-op. QSCC
manages, for the Wendy’s system in the United States and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of
food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies under national agreements with pricing based on
total system volume. We do not control the decisions and activities of QSCC. If QSCC does not properly estimate
the product needs of the Wendy’s system, makes poor purchasing decisions or ceases its operations, or if our
relationship with QSCC is terminated for any reason, system sales, operating costs and supply chain management
could be adversely affected, which could harm our franchisees and have a material adverse impact on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.
Our business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.
Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our restaurants. We devote significant resources to
recruiting and training our managers and hourly employees. Increased labor costs due to competition, increased wages
21","Wendy’s International, Inc."
9,"or employee benefits costs (including various federal, state and local actions to increase minimum wages),
unionization activity or other factors would adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses. In addition,
Wendy’s success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant
managers and staff as well as employees and key personnel at our restaurant support center, and our inability to do so
could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Our success depends in part upon the continued succession and retention of certain key personnel and the effectiveness
of our leadership structure.
We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of
our senior leadership team and other key personnel. Our failure to retain members of our senior leadership team or
other key personnel could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the
efficiency and performance of our business. In addition, changes to our leadership and organizational structure can be
inherently difficult to manage, and if we are unable to implement any such changes effectively, our business, results of
operations and financial results could be adversely affected.
Risks Related to Technology and Cybersecurity
There are risks and uncertainties associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce platforms and
technologies and alternative methods of delivery.
Advances in technologies, including advances in digital food ordering and delivery technologies, and changes in
consumer behavior driven by such advances could have a negative effect on our business. Technology and consumer
offerings continue to develop and evolve, and we expect that new and enhanced technologies and consumer offerings
will be available in the future, including those with a focus on restaurant modernization, restaurant technology, digital
engagement, online ordering and delivery. Our inability to predict consumer acceptance of new technology or our
failure to adequately invest in new technology or adapt to technological developments and industry trends could result
in a loss of customers and related market share. In addition, our competitors, some of whom have greater resources
than we do, may be able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of such changes, which
could harm our competitive position and brand.
An increasing amount of our sales and revenues is derived from digital orders, which includes online ordering
and delivery. We have implemented technology and targeted advertising and promotions to support the growth of our
digital business. If we are unable to continue to grow our digital business, it may be difficult for us to achieve our
planned sales growth. If our digital commerce platforms, including the Wendy’s mobile app and online ordering
system, do not meet customers’ expectations in terms of security, speed, attractiveness or ease of use, customers may
be less inclined to return to those platforms, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and
financial condition. Our business could also be negatively impacted if we are unable to successfully implement or
execute other consumer-facing digital initiatives, such as curbside pick-up and mobile carryout. We rely on third-
party delivery services to fulfill delivery orders, and errors or failures by those providers to make timely deliveries could
cause customers to stop ordering from us. The third-party restaurant delivery business is intensely competitive, with a
number of companies competing for capital, market share, online traffic and delivery drivers. If the third-party
delivery services that we utilize cease or curtail their operations, increase their fees or give greater priority or
promotions on their platforms to our competitors, our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted. If
we are unable to successfully respond to the challenges arising from our increased reliance on our digital business, this
could have a material adverse impact on our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are heavily dependent on computer systems and information technology and any material failure, misuse,
interruption or breach of our systems or technology could adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.
We are heavily dependent on our computer systems and information technology to conduct our business,
including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of
obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends
significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems and information technology. The failure of these systems
and information technology to operate effectively, an interruption in such systems or technology or a breach in
22","Risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:"
10,"security of these systems could be harmful and cause delays in customer service, result in the loss of data, reduce
efficiency or cause delays in operations. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any such
problems or to maintain or upgrade our computer systems and information technology or transition to replacement
systems. Additionally, the success of certain of our strategic initiatives, including the expansion and acceleration of our
consumer-facing digital capabilities to connect with customers and drive growth, is highly dependent on our
technology systems. Any security breach involving our or our franchisees’ point-of-sale or other systems could result in
a loss of consumer confidence and potential costs associated with fraud. Also, despite our considerable efforts and
resources to secure our computer systems and information technology, security breaches, such as unauthorized access
and computer viruses, may occur, resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of
confidential information, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition.
As previously announced, we have implemented a plan to realign and reinvest resources in our IT organization
to strengthen our ability to accelerate growth. We are partnering with a third-party global IT consultant on this new
structure to leverage their global capabilities and enable a more seamless integration between our digital and corporate
IT assets. We are dependent to a significant extent on our ongoing relationship and engagement with the consultant,
including their personnel and resources, technological expertise and ability to help execute our digital, restaurant
technology and enterprise technology initiatives. The inability of us or the consultant to successfully execute our
technology growth initiatives could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.
The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our brand, business, results
of operations and financial condition.
A number of retailers and other companies have experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their
information technology systems. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems,
both internal and those managed by third parties. Because we and our franchisees accept electronic forms of payment
from customers, our business requires the collection and retention of customer data, including credit and debit card
numbers and other personally identifiable information, in various information systems that we and our franchisees
maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we and our franchisees contract to provide credit card
processing and related services. We also maintain important internal data, such as personally identifiable information
about our employees and franchisees and information relating to our operations. Our use of personally identifiable
information is regulated by international, federal and state laws, as well as by certain third-party agreements. As
privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to ensure that we remain
in compliance with those laws and regulations. If our security and information systems are compromised or if our
employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contract terms, and this information is
obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, disrupt our
operations, damage our relationship with customers, franchisees or employees and result in costly litigation,
judgments, or penalties resulting from violation of applicable laws and payment card industry regulations. A cyber
incident could also require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity or a loss in
consumer confidence, sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties or cause us to incur penalties or
remediation and other costs that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
While we have implemented various processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate the risk of a cyber incident
and maintain insurance coverage to address cyber incidents, these measures do not guarantee that a cyber incident
could not occur or that our reputation and financial results will not be adversely affected by such an incident.
As previously reported, in 2015 and 2016, certain of our franchisees experienced cybersecurity incidents. As a
result of those incidents, the Company was named as a defendant in separate class actions brought by consumers and
financial institutions, and certain of our directors and executive officers were named as defendants in a shareholder
derivative action. These civil proceedings sought damages and other relief allegedly arising from the cybersecurity
incidents. In February 2019, the court granted final approval of the settlement of the consumer class action, and in
November 2019, the court granted final approval of the settlement of the financial institutions class action. Both
matters are now considered fully paid and closed. In January 2020, the court granted preliminary approval of the
proposed settlement of the putative shareholder derivative action, which remains subject to certain notice and
objection provisions and final court approval. These and any other claims or investigations related to cybersecurity

have a negative effect on our reputation, and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
Risks Related to Our Indebtedness
The Company and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of the assets of
certain subsidiaries are security, under the terms of a securitized financing facility.
Wendy’s Funding, LLC, a limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the
Company, is the master issuer (the “Master Issuer”) of outstanding senior secured notes under a securitized financing
facility entered into in June 2015. Under the facility, the Master Issuer issued and has outstanding certain series of
fixed rate and variable funding notes (collectively, the “Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes are secured by a security
interest in substantially all of the assets of the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote,
wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as guarantors (collectively, the “Securitization Entities”),
except for certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations as set forth in the indenture governing the Senior
Notes (the “Indenture”) and the related guarantee and collateral agreement. The assets of the Securitization Entities
include most of the domestic and certain of the foreign revenue-generating assets of the Company and its subsidiaries,
which principally consist of franchise-related agreements, certain Company-operated restaurants, intellectual property
and license agreements for the use of intellectual property.
The Senior Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type,
including (i) that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in
respect of the Senior Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment
of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments under certain circumstances, (iii) certain
indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Senior Notes are in
stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar
matters. The Senior Notes are subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture,
including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of global gross sales for
specified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, an
event of default, and the failure to repay or refinance on the applicable scheduled maturity date. The Senior Notes are
also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest,
principal, or other amounts due on or with respect to the Senior Notes, failure to comply with covenants within
certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security
interests to be effective, and certain judgments. In the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the
Indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the Indenture or the failure to repay the
securitized debt at the end of the applicable term), the funds available to the Company would be reduced or
eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business.
In addition, the Indenture and the related management agreement contain various covenants that limit the
Company and its subsidiaries’ ability to engage in specified types of transactions, subject to certain exceptions,
including, for example, to (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, (ii) sell certain assets, (iii) create or incur
liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness or (iv) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially
all of their assets. As a result of these restrictions, the Company may not have adequate resources or flexibility to
continue to manage the business and provide for growth of the Wendy’s system, which could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s future growth prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
We have a significant amount of debt outstanding, and such indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.
As of January 3, 2021, the Company had approximately $2.2 billion of outstanding debt on its balance sheet.
Additionally, a subsidiary of the Company has issued variable funding notes, which allows for the borrowing of up to
$250.0 million from time to time on a revolving basis. This level of debt could have significant consequences on the
Company’s future operations, including: (i) making it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under
outstanding debt; (ii) resulting in an event of default if the Company’s subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial
and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of the
Company’s subsidiaries’ debt becoming immediately due and payable; (iii) reducing the availability of the Company’s
24","Wendy’s International, Inc."
12,"cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, equity and debt repurchases, dividends, acquisitions and other
general corporate purposes, and limiting the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;
(iv) subjecting the Company to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on indebtedness with variable
interest rates; (v) limiting the Company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to, and increasing its vulnerability to,
changes in the Company’s business, the industry in which it operates and the general economy; and (vi) placing the
Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that are less leveraged. Further, the Company’s
outstanding variable funding notes may accrue interest based on the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”), which
is expected to be discontinued after 2021. If LIBOR is discontinued, we may need to renegotiate certain loan
documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders or the resulting impact
on our interest expense.
The ability of the Company to make payments on, repay or refinance its debt, and any additional debt, and to
fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating
performance and ability to generate significant cash flows. In addition, the ability of the Company to borrow funds in
the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in the securitized financing
facility and other debt agreements, and other agreements it may enter into in the future. Specifically, the Company
will need to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests. There can be no assurance that the
Company’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available
under the Company’s securitized financing facility or other debt agreements or from other sources in an amount
sufficient to enable the Company to pay its debt or to fund its dividend and other liquidity needs. If the Company’s
subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or
restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If the Company’s
subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment
and other obligations.
In addition to the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries have significant
contractual requirements for the purchase of soft drinks. If consumer preferences change and customers purchase
fewer soft drinks than expected or estimated, such contractual commitments may adversely affect the financial
condition of the Company. The Company has also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of
franchisees entering into debt arrangements for new restaurant development and equipment financing. In addition,
certain of the Company’s subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective
franchisees for which they have been indemnified. These commitments, guarantees and other liabilities could have an
adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity and the ability of its subsidiaries to meet payment obligations.
The Company may incur additional indebtedness, guarantees, commitments or other liabilities in the future. If
new debt, guarantees, commitments or other liabilities are added to the Company’s current consolidated debt levels,
the related risks that the Company now faces could be amplified.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock
There can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent we will pay dividends on our common stock in the
future.
Holders of our common stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may
declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Any dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of
Directors and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board
may deem relevant from time to time. In addition, because Wendy’s is a holding company, its ability to declare and
pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its
subsidiaries. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to the holding company is dependent upon their
ability to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including the requirements
and restrictions under our securitized financing facility and other debt agreements.
A substantial amount of our common stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.
Nelson Peltz, our Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, Peter May, our Vice Chairman and former
President and Chief Operating Officer, Matthew Peltz, a director of the Company, and Edward Garden, a former
director of the Company, beneficially own shares of our outstanding common stock that collectively constitute
25","All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities, events or developments that the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements."
13,"Existing and changing legal and regulatory requirements, as well as an increasing focus on environmental, social and
governance issues, could adversely affect our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.
Each Wendy’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in
the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to federal laws, rules and regulations and
requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules. State and local government
authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those
operations. There can be no assurance that we and our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures
in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay the opening of such restaurants
in the future. In addition, more stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to tax, zoning, land
use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.
We are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of a franchise, including rules by
the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Various state, provincial and foreign laws regulate certain aspects of the franchise
relationship, including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises. The failure to comply with these laws and
regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary
suspension on future franchise sales, fines and penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution, any of
which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We could also face lawsuits by franchisees based
upon alleged violations of these laws. We and our franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which
governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, along with the ADA, family leave
mandates and a variety of other state laws that govern these and other employment law matters. Changes in laws,
rules, regulations and governmental policies could increase our costs, result in increased litigation, investigations,
enforcement actions, fines or liabilities and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The same consequences may result should any law, rule, regulation, governmental policy or judicial decision declare
that Wendy’s is a joint employer with our franchisees. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with
our complex regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
We are also subject to legal and compliance risks and associated liability related to privacy and data collection,
protection and management as it relates to information associated with our technology-related services and platforms
made available to customers, employees, franchisees, business partners or other third parties. We are subject to a
variety of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations in this area. These laws and regulations have been
subject to frequent change, and there may be jurisdictions that propose or enact new data privacy requirements in the
future. Failure to meet applicable data privacy requirements could result in substantial penalties and materially
adversely impact our financial results or brand perceptions. Additionally, changing laws and regulations could require
us and our franchisees to change or limit the way we collect or use information in operating our business, which may
result in additional costs, limit our marketing or growth strategies and adversely affect our business and results of
operations.
Additionally, there has been increasing public focus by investors, environmental activists, the media and
governmental and nongovernmental organizations on social and environmental sustainability matters, including
packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, human rights, climate change, carbon footprints and land, energy
and water use. As a result, we have experienced increased pressure and expectations to make commitments, establish
goals or set targets with respect to various environmental and social issues and to take the actions necessary to meet
those commitments, goals and targets. If we are not effective in addressing social and environmental sustainability
matters, consumer trust in our brand may suffer. In addition, the actions needed to achieve our sustainability goals
could result in market, operational, execution and other costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business and financial condition.
Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that have been or may be filed.
We currently maintain insurance that we believe to be adequate for businesses of our size and type. However,
there are types of losses we could encounter that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically
reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism. In addition, we currently self-insure a
significant portion of expected losses under workers’ compensation, general liability, auto liability and property
insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our
reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense, which could harm our business and
adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We also currently maintain insurance coverage to

Introduction
This “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of The
Wendy’s Company (“The Wendy’s Company” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or
“our”) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear
elsewhere within this report. Certain statements we make under this Item 7 constitute “forward-looking statements”
under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements and Projections” in “Part I” preceding “Item 1 - Business.” You should consider our forward-looking
statements in light of the risks discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in Item 1A above, as well as our
consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report and
our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
The Wendy’s Company is the parent company of its 100% owned subsidiary holding company, Wendy’s
Restaurants, LLC (“Wendy’s Restaurants”). The principal 100% owned subsidiary of Wendy’s Restaurants is
Wendy’s International, LLC and its subsidiaries (“Wendy’s”). Wendy’s is primarily engaged in the business of
operating, developing and franchising a system of distinctive quick-service restaurants serving high quality food.
Wendy’s opened its first restaurant in Columbus, Ohio in 1969. Today, Wendy’s is the #2 quick-service restaurant
company in the hamburger sandwich segment in the United States (the “U.S.”) based on traffic share*, and the third
largest globally with 6,828 restaurants in the U.S and 30 foreign countries and U.S. territories as of January 3, 2021.
(*Based on The NPD Group CREST®data for the twelve months ended December 2020.)
The Company is comprised of the following segments: (1) Wendy’s U.S., (2) Wendy’s International and
(3) Global Real Estate & Development. Wendy’s U.S. includes the operation and franchising of Wendy’s restaurants
in the U.S. and derives its revenues from sales at Company-operated restaurants and royalties, fees and advertising
fund collections from franchised restaurants. Wendy’s International includes the franchising of Wendy’s restaurants in
countries and territories other than the U.S. and derives its revenues from royalties, fees and advertising fund
collections from franchised restaurants. Global Real Estate & Development includes real estate activity for owned sites
and sites leased from third parties, which are leased and/or subleased to franchisees, and also includes our share of the
income of our TimWen real estate joint venture. In addition, Global Real Estate & Development earns fees from
facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers (“Franchise Flips”) and providing other development-related
services to franchisees. In this Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations,” the Company reports on the segment profit for each of the three segments described above. The
Company measures segment profit based on segment adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (“EBITDA”). Segment adjusted EBITDA excludes certain unallocated general and administrative
expenses and other items that vary from period to period without correlation to the Company’s core operating
performance. See “Results of Operations” below and Note 26 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
contained in Item 8 herein for segment financial information.
The Company’s fiscal reporting periods consist of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday closest to
December 31 and are referred to herein as (1) “the year ended January 3, 2021” or “2020,” which consisted of
53 weeks, (2) “the year ended December 29, 2019” or “2019,” which consisted of 52 weeks, and (3) “the year ended

Executive Overview
Our Business
As of January 3, 2021, the Wendy’s restaurant system was comprised of 6,828 restaurants, with 5,881 Wendy’s
restaurants in operation in the U.S. Of the U.S. restaurants, 361 were operated by the Company and 5,520 were
operated by a total of 228 franchisees. In addition, at January 3, 2021, there were 947 Wendy’s restaurants in
operation in 30 foreign countries and U.S. territories, all of which were franchised.

subject to similar financial and business risks, including the opportunity for growth. The guideline company
method of the market approach provides an indication of value by relating the equity or invested capital
(debt plus equity) of guideline companies to various measures of their earnings and cash flow, then applying
such multiples to the business being valued. The result of applying the guideline company approach is
adjusted based on the incremental value associated with a controlling interest in the business. This “control
premium” represents the amount a new controlling shareholder would pay for the benefits resulting from
synergies and other potential benefits derived from controlling the enterprise.
The negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the decline in same-restaurant sales described
in “Sales Trends and COVID-19 Update” above and the volatility in the price of our common stock,
resulted in the Company performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test in March 2020. The
Company’s goodwill impairment test in March 2020 included three reporting units, which were comprised
of its (1) U.S. Company-operated and franchise restaurants, (2) Canada franchise restaurants and (3) global
real estate and development operations. Based on the results of our goodwill impairment test, we determined
the fair values of our U.S. Company-operated and franchise restaurants and our Canada franchise restaurants
reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values. The goodwill impairment test for our global real
estate and development operations also indicated the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying
value; however, the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by only a nominal amount.
Given the limited excess of the fair value over carrying value, this reporting unit is more sensitive to changes
in assumptions regarding its fair value. As of the date of our analysis in the first quarter of 2020, a 50 basis
point increase in the discount rate, or a moderate decline in estimated future cash flows, would have resulted
in the fair value of the reporting unit being less than its carrying value.
For the annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2020, we elected to perform a qualitative
assessment for the U.S. Company-operated and franchise restaurants and the Canada franchise restaurants,
and we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for the global real estate and development
operations. The qualitative assessment indicated the fair value of goodwill of our U.S. Company-operated
and franchise restaurants and the Canada franchise restaurants was more likely than not greater than the
carrying amount. Our quantitative goodwill impairment test for our global real estate and development
operations indicated that there had been no impairment and the fair value of this reporting unit of
$1,314.7 million was approximately 13% in excess of its carrying value. A 100 basis point increase in the
discount rate, or a moderate decline in estimated future cash flows, would have resulted in the fair value of
the reporting unit being less than its carrying value. As of January 3, 2021, the goodwill balance associated
with our global real estate and development operations was $122.5 million.
Our indefinite-lived intangible assets represent trademarks and totaled $903.0 million as of January 3, 2021.
We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. Our annual impairment test may be completed
through a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is more
likely than not greater than the carrying amount. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, or if a
qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the estimated carrying value exceeds the fair
value, we test for impairment using a quantitative process. Our quantitative process includes comparing the
carrying value to the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, with any excess recognized as an
impairment loss. Our critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible
assets include the anticipated future revenues of Company-operated and franchised restaurants and the
resulting cash flows.
The Company performed a quantitative impairment test of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in March
2020 as a result of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the results of our impairment
test, we determined the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets significantly exceeded their carrying
value.
For the annual impairment test of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2020, we
elected to perform a qualitative assessment. The qualitative assessment indicated the fair value of our
indefinite-lived intangible assets was more likely than not greater than the carrying amount.

for foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $0.3 million, as well as state and local net operating loss
carryforwards of $43.4 million that will begin to expire in 2021. We believe it is more likely than not that
the benefit from certain net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. In recognition of
this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $50.0 million.
 Income tax uncertainties:
We measure income tax uncertainties in accordance with a two-step process of evaluating a tax position. We
first determine if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on
the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold
is then measured, for purposes of financial statement recognition, as the largest amount that has a greater
than 50% likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement. We have unrecognized tax benefits of
$21.0 million, which if resolved favorably would reduce our tax expense by $16.6 million at January 3, 2021.
We accrue interest related to uncertain tax positions in “Interest expense, net” and penalties in “General and
administrative.” At January 3, 2021, we had $0.9 million accrued for interest and $0.04 million accrued for
penalties.
The Company participates in the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) Compliance Assurance Process
(“CAP”). As part of CAP, tax years are examined on a contemporaneous basis so that all or most issues are
resolved prior to the filing of the tax return. As such, our U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2009
through 2018 have been settled. The statute of limitations for the Company’s state tax returns vary, but
generally the Company’s state income tax returns from its 2017 fiscal year forward remain subject to
examination. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for any liabilities, including interest and
penalties that may result from the completion of these examinations.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Certain statements the Company makes under this Item 7A constitute “forward-looking statements” under the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and
Projections” in “Part I” preceding “Item 1. Business.”
We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, changes in commodity prices and foreign currency
fluctuations primarily related to the Canadian dollar. In the normal course of business, we employ established policies
and procedures to manage our exposure to these changes using financial instruments we deem appropriate.
Interest Rate Risk
Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact on our earnings and cash
flows. Our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes and we had no outstanding
derivative instruments as of January 3, 2021.
Our long-term debt, including the current portion, aggregated $2,283.2 million as of January 3, 2021
(excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and the effect of purchase accounting adjustments). The Company’s
predominantly fixed-rate debt structure has reduced its exposure to interest rate increases that could adversely affect its
earnings and cash flows. The Company is exposed to interest rate increases under its Series 2019-1 Class A-1 Notes
and its 2020-1 Class A-1 Notes (collectively, the “Class A-1 Notes”), as well as its U.S. advertising fund revolving line
of credit; however, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Class A-1 Notes or U.S. advertising fund
revolving line of credit as of January 3, 2021. The Company has outstanding borrowings of C$2.5 million under a
Canadian subsidiary’s revolving credit facility as of January 3, 2021, which bears interest at the Bank of Montreal
Prime Rate. An increase or decrease of 1.0% in the effective interest rate applied to the outstanding borrowings under
our Canadian subsidiary’s revolving credit facility would not have a material effect on our consolidated results of

information on the Company’s debt structure and its securitized financing facility.
In addition, LIBOR is expected to be discontinued after 2021. If LIBOR is discontinued, we may need to
renegotiate certain loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our
lenders or the resulting impact on our interest expense.
Commodity Price Risk
We purchase certain food products, such as beef, chicken, pork, cheese and grains, that are affected by changes
in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to variability in our food costs. QSCC, our independent supply
chain purchasing co-op, negotiates contracts with approved suppliers on behalf of the Wendy’s system in the U.S. and
Canada to ensure favorable pricing for its major food products, as well as maintain an adequate supply of fresh food
products. While price volatility can occur, which would impact profit margins, the purchasing contracts seek to limit
the variability of these commodity costs without establishing any firm purchase commitments by us or our
franchisees. In addition, we believe that alternative suppliers are generally available. Our ability to recover increased
commodity costs through higher pricing is, at times, limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.
Foreign Currency Risk
Our exposures to foreign currency risk are primarily related to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to the
U.S. dollar for our Canadian operations. We monitor these exposures and periodically determine our need for the use
of strategies intended to lessen or limit our exposure to these fluctuations. We have exposure related to our investment
in a Canadian subsidiary which is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. The exposure to Canadian dollar exchange
rates on the Company’s cash flows primarily includes imports paid for by Canadian operations in U.S. dollars and
payments from the Company’s Canadian operations to the Company’s U.S. operations in U.S. dollars. Revenues
from our Canadian operations for the year ended January 3, 2021 represented approximately 5% of our total
revenues. An immediate 10% change in Canadian dollar exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their levels at
January 3, 2021 would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Wendy’s Company and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended January 3,
2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 3, 2021 and
December 29, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
January 3, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2021, based on
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 3, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion
on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, during 2019, the Company adopted the Financial
Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) new standard related to leases using the modified retrospective approach.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to
those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial
statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,

Cash and Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when acquired are considered cash
equivalents. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents principally consist of cash in bank and money market mutual
fund accounts and are primarily not in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured accounts.
We believe that our vulnerability to risk concentrations in our cash equivalents is mitigated by (1) our policies
restricting the eligibility, credit quality and concentration limits for our placements in cash equivalents and
(2) insurance from the Securities Investor Protection Corporation of up to $500 per account, as well as supplemental
private insurance coverage maintained by substantially all of our brokerage firms, to the extent our cash equivalents
are held in brokerage accounts.
Restricted Cash
In accordance with the Company’s securitized financing facility, certain cash accounts have been established
with the trustee for the benefit of the trustee and the noteholders and are restricted in their use. Such restricted cash
primarily represents cash collections and cash reserves held by the trustee to be used for payments of principal, interest
and commitment fees required for the Company’s senior secured notes. Restricted cash also includes cash collected by
the Advertising Funds, usage of which is restricted for advertising activities and is included in “Advertising funds
restricted assets.” Refer to Note 7 for further information.
Accounts and Notes Receivable, Net
Accounts and notes receivable, net, consist primarily of royalties, rents, property taxes and franchise fees due
principally from franchisees, credit card receivables, insurance receivables and refundable income taxes. Reserve
estimates include consideration of the likelihood of default expected over the estimated life of the receivable. The
Company periodically assesses the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts on its receivables based upon several
key credit quality indicators such as outstanding past due balances, the financial strength of the obligor, the estimated
fair value of any underlying collateral and agreement characteristics.
We believe that our vulnerability to risk concentrations in our receivables is mitigated by (1) favorable historical
collectability on past due balances, (2) recourse to the underlying collateral regarding sales-type and direct financing
lease receivables, and (3) our expectations for fluctuations in general market conditions. Receivables are considered
delinquent once they are contractually past due under the terms of the underlying agreements. As of January 3, 2021,
there were no material receivables more than one year past due.
Inventories
The Company’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined in
accordance with the first-in, first-out method and consist primarily of restaurant food items and paper supplies.
Properties and Depreciation and Amortization
Properties are stated at cost, including capitalized internal costs of employees to the extent such employees are
dedicated to specific restaurant construction projects, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation
and amortization of properties is computed principally on the straight-line basis using the following estimated useful
lives of the related major classes of properties: 3 to 20 years for office and restaurant equipment (including
technology), 3 to 15 years for transportation equipment and 7 to 30 years for buildings and improvements. When the
Company commits to a plan to cease using certain properties before the end of their estimated useful lives,
depreciation expense is accelerated to reflect the use of the assets over their shortened useful lives. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the respective leases,
including periods covered by renewal options that the Company is reasonably assured of exercising.

Significant Assumptions and Judgments
Management makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding each new lease and sublease agreement,
renewal and amendment, including, but not limited to, property values, market rents, property lives, discount rates
and probable term, all of which can impact (1) the classification and accounting for a lease or sublease as operating or
finance, including sales-type and direct financing, (2) the Rent Holiday and escalations in payment that are taken into
consideration when calculating Straight-Line Rent, (3) the term over which leasehold improvements for each
restaurant are amortized and (4) the values and lives of adjustments to the initial ROU asset where the Company is
the lessee, or favorable and unfavorable leases where the Company is the lessor. The amount of depreciation and
amortization, interest and rent expense and income reported would vary if different estimates and assumptions were
used.
Concentration of Risk
Wendy’s had no customers which accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenues in 2020, 2019 or 2018.
As of January 3, 2021, Wendy’s had one main in-line distributor of food, packaging and beverage products, excluding
breads, that serviced approximately 67% of Wendy’s restaurants in the U.S. and four additional in-line distributors
that, in the aggregate, serviced approximately 32% of Wendy’s restaurants in the U.S. We believe that our
vulnerability to risk concentrations related to significant vendors and sources of our raw materials is mitigated as we
believe that there are other vendors who would be able to service our requirements. However, if a disruption of service
from any of our main in-line distributors was to occur, we could experience short-term increases in our costs while
distribution channels were adjusted.
Wendy’s restaurants are principally located throughout the U.S. and to a lesser extent, in 30 foreign countries
and U.S. territories with the largest number in Canada. Wendy’s U.S. restaurants are located in 50 states and the
District of Columbia, with the largest number in Florida, Texas, Ohio, Georgia, California, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania and Michigan. Because our restaurant operations are generally located throughout the U.S. and to a
much lesser extent, Canada and other foreign countries and U.S. territories, we believe the risk of geographic
concentration is not significant. We could be adversely affected by changing consumer preferences resulting from
concerns over nutritional or safety aspects of beef, chicken, french fries or other products we sell or the effects of food
safety events or disease outbreaks. Our exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily related to fluctuations in the
Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar for our Canadian operations. However, our exposure to Canadian dollar
foreign currency risk is mitigated by the fact that there are no Company-operated restaurants in Canada and less than
10% of Wendy’s franchised restaurants are in Canada.
The Company is subject to credit risk through its accounts receivable consisting primarily of amounts due from
franchisees for royalties, franchise fees and rent. In addition, we have notes receivable from certain of our franchisees.
The financial condition of these franchisees is largely dependent upon the underlying business trends of the Wendy’s
brand and market conditions within the quick-service restaurant industry. This concentration of credit risk is
mitigated, in part, by the number of franchisees and the short-term nature of the franchise receivables.
New Accounting Standards Adopted
Income Taxes
In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance to simplify the
accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles and the simplification of areas
such as franchise taxes, transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill, separate entity financial
statements and interim recognition of enactment of tax laws or tax rate changes. The Company early adopted this
amendment during the first quarter of 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

The risk-free interest rate represents the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bond yield correlating to the expected life
of the stock options granted. The expected option life represents the period of time that the stock options granted are
expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise trends for similar grants. The expected volatility is based on the
historical market price volatility of the Company over a period equivalent to the expected option life. The expected
dividend yield represents the Company’s annualized average yield for regular quarterly dividends declared prior to the
respective stock option grant dates.
The Black-Scholes Model has limitations on its effectiveness including that it was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable and that the
model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, such as expected stock price volatility. Employee stock option
awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act). The management of the Company, under
the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an
assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting for the Company as of January 3, 2021.
The assessment was performed using the criteria for effective internal control reflected in the Internal Control—
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).
Based on the assessment of the system of internal control for the Company, the management of the Company
believes that as of January 3, 2021, internal control over financial reporting of the Company was effective.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an attestation report
dated March 3, 2021 on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting of the Company during the fourth
quarter of 2020 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial
reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any control system, including the potential for human
error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures. Additionally, judgments in decision-
making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. An effective control system can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control objectives of the system are adequately met.
Accordingly, the management of the Company, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
does not expect that the control system can prevent or detect all error or fraud. Finally, projections of any evaluation
or assessment of effectiveness of a control system to future periods are subject to the risks that, over time, controls may
become inadequate because of changes in an entity’s operating environment or deterioration in the degree of
compliance with policies or procedures.

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Item 1. Business
Overview
Nuance Communications, Inc. (""We"", ""Nuance"", or the ""Company"") is a technology pioneer and market leader in conversational artificial intelligence
(""AI"") and ambient clinical intelligence. We deliver intuitive solutions that understand, analyze, and respond to people - amplifying their ability to help
others with increased productivity and security. We work with thousands of organizations globally across healthcare, financial services,
telecommunications, government, and retail - to create stronger relationships and better experiences for their customers and workforce. We offer our
customers a wide range of products and services, including clinical documentation, solutions for clinicians, radiologists and care teams, as well as
intelligent customer engagement and security biometric solutions for leading brands. In addition, our solutions increasingly utilize our innovations in AI,
including cognitive sciences and machine learning to create smarter, more natural experiences with technology. Using advanced analytics and algorithms,
our technologies create personalized experiences and transform the way people interact with information and the technology around them. We market and
sell our solutions and technologies around the world directly through a dedicated sales force and a global network of resellers, including system integrators,
independent software vendors, value-added resellers, distributors, hardware vendors, telecommunications carriers and e-commerce websites.
We are a global organization steeped in research and development (""R&D""). We have approximately 1,600 language scientists, developers, and engineers
dedicated to continually refining our technologies and advancing our portfolio to better meet our customers’ diverse and changing needs. As of
September 30, 2020, we had operations and sales force in 28 countries. Our corporate headquarters is in Burlington, Massachusetts, and our international
headquarters is in Dublin, Ireland. In fiscal year 2020, our revenue was approximately $1.5 billion.
In connection with our ongoing comprehensive portfolio and business review, during the first quarter of 2021, we announced our strategic plan to sell our
medical transcription and EHR go-live businesses to Assured Healthcare Partners and Aeries Technology Group. These businesses provide critical support
to healthcare organizations, and upon the closing of the sale, Nuance will be both a minority stakeholder and business partner committed to the success of
the new business, named DeliverHealth Solutions.
As a result, we expect the results of medical transcription and EHR go-live businesses to be included within discontinued operations on the consolidated
statements of operations, and the related assets and liabilities to be classified as assets and liabilities held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets
effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.
Our Strategy
With the sale of our Imaging segment, the spin-off of our Automotive segment, the exit of our Mobile Operator Services business and the wind-down of
Devices, as well as the anticipated sale of our medical transcription and EHR go-live businesses, we are

driven program, allow peer comparisons and identify opportunities for improvement. Our Coding solutions offer cloud-based, enterprise-wide
products and services that are designed to improve coder productivity and maintain the highest levels of accuracy and compliance. These solutions
effectively manage and monitor the types of compliance coding challenges that can put a health system at risk for delayed and reduced
reimbursement. We help manage the workflow by bringing together the tools needed to provide better visibility into key coding performance
indicators. Coder productivity can be enhanced by enabling a more complete and accurate review of both inpatient and outpatient encounters that
are associated with facility and professional service fees.
•Transcriptions Solutions: These solutions offer cloud-based transcription capabilities for clinical documentation that use background speech
recognition to increase Medical Language Specialists’ productivity and reduce costs. Helping organizations simplify the documentation process by
offering users an automated and flexible workflow with options designed to meet a facility’s specific needs, our solutions and services offer fast,
accurate, and usable documentation with more seamless and fully automated processes that can identify discrete information and securely upload
data directly into the EHR. Clinicians using EHRs can accurately document entire patient encounters using a mobile device or their standard
dictation methods.
The channels for distribution in the Healthcare segment utilize our direct sales force to address the market and our professional services organization to
support the implementation requirements of the healthcare industry. Direct distribution is supplemented by distributors, resellers, and partnerships with a
variety of healthcare IT providers.
Areas of expansion and focus for our Healthcare segment include innovation in AI and development of deeply verticalized and specialized intelligence to
integrate with and further enhance our existing products; expansion of Nuance DAX which takes advantage of our cloud ‑ based speech recognition
technology and benefits from increasing levels of workflow, task, and knowledge automation; investment in our cloud-based offerings, operations, and
network security; entering new and adjacent markets such as ambulatory care; and expanding our international capabilities.
Enterprise
Our Enterprise segment is a leading provider of AI-powered intelligent customer engagement solutions and services, which enable enterprises and contact
centers to enhance and automate customer service and sales engagement.
Our market-leading Intelligent Engagement platform powered by conversational AI has been recognized and awarded by independent industry research
firms like Forrester, Gartner and Opus. We are also differentiated by our ability to enable enterprises to implement voice and text-based virtual assistants
and to provide automated service and sales engagement across voice and digital channels, as well as the ability of our solutions to seamlessly transition to
agent-assisted engagement to complete a customer service request. Our intelligent self-service solutions are highly secure, predictive, and accurate,
resulting in increased customer acquisition and satisfaction while simultaneously reducing the costs associated with delivering customer service for the
enterprise.
Our solutions and services portfolio now spans voice, behavioral and conversational biometrics, digital virtual assistant capabilities, across voice, mobile,
web and messaging channels, with inbound and outbound customer service and engagement in over 85 languages for voice, text, dialog and natural
language understanding (""NLU""). Our Enterprise segment utilizes a hybrid go-to-market model, selling both direct and through reseller partners.
Enterprise segment revenues were $530.0 million, $510.8 million, and $483.2 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Enterprise segment
revenues represented 35.8%, 33.5% and 30.6% of total segment revenues in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For each of fiscal years 2020,
2019, and 2018, no customer accounted for more than 10% of Enterprise revenue.
Our principal solutions for the Enterprise segment include the following:
•Intelligent Engagement Solutions: Our open, modular cloud platform provides enterprises with the ability to implement virtual- and live-
engagement across nearly all digital voice and text channels. The platform supports virtual assistant, live engagement and proactive notification
services, using our conversational AI, engagement AI and security AI capabilities.

Our Intelligent Engagement cloud is sold both direct and through partners and are largely multi-year agreements with volume-based transactional
pricing and associated professional services.
•Conversational AI: In 2020 we launched Nuance Mix™, an open enterprise-grade, SaaS tooling suite for creating advanced conversational
experiences that power virtual assistants and IVR systems, using our industry-leading and cloud-agnostic conversational AI. As global organizations
increasingly look to integrate Conversational AI into their digital and voice customer engagements, the ability to build a conversational experience
once and deploy it across channels and modalities has become critical. Nuance Mix allows these organizations to build, maintain and deliver the
complex enterprise-grade conversational experiences that help brands acquire customers and get vital customer queries and transactions resolved.
Our conversational AI solutions are integrated with IVR systems provided to the customer by us or by a wide range of third-party IVR and contact
center vendors, who often resell our IVR Voice Solutions. Our solutions in this category include automated speech recognition (""ASR""), TTS, NLU
and dialog engines. We also offer a cloud hosted IVR and voice automation platform which is largely sold direct through multi-year agreements with
volume-based transactional pricing and associated professional services.
•Engagement AI: Our digital solutions are a mix of intelligent virtual assistants and human-assisted customer engagement. This enables companies
to target the right visitor with the right message at the right time, delivering a customer-centric experience across all channels. Nuance enables
businesses to design a seamless experience once and deploy it on any channel-browsers, inside an app, Apple Business Chat, via text messaging,
social media, in third-party messaging apps, such as Facebook Messenger, Google’s Business Messages and WhatsApp, or for smart home devices-
while adjusting the experience to the individual channel. Our Engagement AI solutions also enable contact center agents to be more productive by
giving them easier access to information with relevant, real-time insights, visibility into active conversations, and proactive recommendations to
improve the customer and agent experience.
•Security AI: These solutions enable organizations to automate the identification and verification of their customers while preventing fraud in digital
and voice channels. In 2020, we launched Nuance Gatekeeper, a cloud-native biometric security platform that combines industry-leading voice,
behavioral conversational biometrics with intelligent detectors and an underlying risk engine to authenticate customers, identify fraudsters, and
detect cases of potential fraud, seamlessly and in seconds. We license this solution via perpetual maintenance and support (""M&S""), on-premise
transactional and cloud transactional models.
Areas of focus and expansion for our Enterprise segment include increasing the penetration of our full portfolio into our large existing customer base;
bringing our Intelligent Engagement cloud to new customers, the midmarket and new international markets, especially Western Europe, Japan and
Australia; expansion of our security and biometrics cloud solution; and continued investment in our AI-powered solutions to ensure we retain leadership
throughout our solutions.
Other
Our Other segment currently consists primarily of voicemail transcription services following the sale of our Mobile Operator Services business and the
wind-down of our Devices business in 2019.
Other segment revenues were $33.9 million, $61.5 million, and $109.1 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Other segment revenues
represented 2.3%, 4.0% and 6.9% of total segment revenues in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Intellectual Property
Over our history, we have developed and acquired extensive technology assets, intellectual property, and industry expertise in ASR and NLU technologies
that provide us with a competitive advantage in our markets. Our technologies are based on complex algorithms that require extensive amounts of acoustic
and language models, and recognition and understanding techniques. A significant investment in capital and time would be necessary to replicate our
current capabilities.
We continue to invest in technologies to maintain our market-leading position and to develop new applications. We rely on a portfolio of patents,
copyrights, trademarks, services marks, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property
and proprietary rights. As of September 30, 2020, we held approximately 2,350 patents and 300 patent applications.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below when evaluating the company and when deciding whether to invest in the
company. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we
do not currently believe are important to an investor may also harm our business operations. If any of the events, contingencies, circumstances or
conditions described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or our results of operations could be seriously harmed. If that happens, the
trading price of our common stock could decline.
Risks Related to Our Business
Our liquidity and operations have been adversely impacted, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may continue to
be adversely impacted, by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic. The global spread of COVID-19 has created
significant market volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our results of operations and liquidity
as of September 30, 2020, and may continue to adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we have not
experienced significant disruptions to our ability to conduct business thus far as a result of the pandemic, we are currently conducting business with
substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, virtualization or cancellation of customer and employee events, and remote sales,
implementation, and support activities, among other modifications.
The extent to which the coronavirus pandemic will impact our business, operations, and financial results in the future will depend on numerous evolving
factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including:
•the duration and scope of the pandemic;
•governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic and the impact of those actions on global economic activity;
7",Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
8,"Table of Contents
•the actions taken in response to economic disruption;
•the impact of business disruptions on our customers and partners and the resulting impact on their demand for our products and services;
•our customers’ and partners’ ability to pay for our products and services; and
•our ability to provide our products and services, including as a result of our employees working remotely and/or closures of offices and facilities.
We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continually assessing its potential effects on our business. Many of our customers
are hospitals and other healthcare providers that are facing capital shortages and other changes to their businesses as they focus on fighting the pandemic.
As a result, in particular with respect to our healthcare customers, our net new sales may continue to be lower than expected; our ability to recognize
revenue may continue to be negatively impacted due to implementation delays, decreased utilization of certain products such as our HIM, PowerScribe and
DAX solutions, decrease in volumes where we have transaction-based revenue, or other factors; our collections may continue to be delayed, which will
negatively affect our cash flows; some customers may go out of business, and we will be unsecured creditors and may not be able to collect what we are
owed; our ability to provide 24x7 worldwide support to our customers may be affected; and our employees’ productivity may be negatively impacted as a
result of almost all of our workforce working from home. The pandemic and accompanying market volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption may
also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the “Risk Factors” set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The ultimate
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the operational changes we have made in response cannot be accurately predicted at this time.
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and rapidly changing and we may be unable to compete successfully.
There are a number of companies that develop or may develop products that compete in our targeted markets. The markets for our products and services are
characterized by intense competition, evolving industry and regulatory standards, emerging business and distribution models, disruptive software and
hardware technology developments, short product and service life cycles, price sensitivity on the part of customers, and frequent new product introductions,
including alternatives for certain of our products that offer limited functionality at significantly lower costs or free of charge. Current and potential
competitors have established, or may establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their technologies
to address the needs of our prospective customers. Furthermore, there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We
expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions.
The competition in our targeted markets could adversely affect our operating results by reducing the volume of the products and solutions we license or sell
or the prices we can charge. Some of our current or potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also
devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do, and in certain cases may be able to include or combine their
competitive products or technologies with other of their products or technologies in a manner whereby the competitive functionality is available at lower
cost or free of charge within the larger offering. To the extent they do so, market acceptance and penetration of our products, and therefore our revenue and
bookings, may be adversely affected. Our success depends substantially upon our ability to enhance our products and technologies and to develop and
introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products and features that meet changing customer requirements and incorporate technological
enhancements. If we are unable to develop or acquire new products and enhance functionalities or technologies to adapt to these changes our business will
suffer.
Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and this may cause our stock price to decline.
Our revenue, bookings and operating results have fluctuated materially in the past and we expect such fluctuations to continue in the future. These
fluctuations may cause our results of operations not to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors which would likely cause the price of our
stock to decline. Factors that may contribute to fluctuations in operating results include:
•volume, timing and fulfillment of customer orders and receipt of royalty reports;
•fluctuating sales by our channel partners to their customers;
•customers delaying their purchasing decisions in anticipation of new versions of our products;
•contractual counterparties failing to meet their contractual commitments to us;
•introduction of new products by us or our competitors;
•cybersecurity or data breaches;
•seasonality in purchasing patterns of our customers;
•reduction in the prices of our products in response to competition, market conditions or contractual obligations;
8",This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

•returns and allowance charges in excess of accrued amounts;
•timing of significant marketing and sales promotions;
•impairment of goodwill or intangible assets;
•the pace of the transition to an on-demand and transactional revenue model;
•delayed realization of synergies resulting from our acquisitions;
•accounts receivable that are not collectible and write-offs of excess or obsolete inventory;
•increased expenditures incurred pursuing new product or market opportunities;
•higher than anticipated costs related to fixed-price contracts with our customers;
•change in costs due to regulatory or trade restrictions;
•expenses incurred in litigation matters, whether initiated by us or brought by third parties against us, and settlements or judgments we are required to
pay in connection with disputes; and
•general economic trends as they affect the customer bases into which we sell.
Due to the foregoing factors, among others, our revenue, bookings and operating results are difficult to forecast. Our expense levels are based in significant
part on our expectations of future revenue, and we may not be able to reduce our expenses quickly to respond to near-term shortfalls in projected revenue.
Therefore, our failure to meet revenue expectations would seriously harm our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
A significant portion of our revenue and bookings are derived, and a significant portion of our research and development activities are based, outside
the United States. Our results could be harmed by economic, political, regulatory, foreign currency fluctuation and other risks associated with these
international regions.
Because we operate worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We generate most of our international
revenue and bookings in Canada and Europe, and we anticipate that revenue and bookings from international operations could increase in the future. In
addition, some of our products are developed outside the United States and we have a large number of employees in India who provide transcription and
development services, and we also have a large number of employees in Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom who provide professional services. We
conduct a significant portion of the development of our voice recognition and natural language understanding solutions in Canada and Germany. We also
have significant research and development resources in Austria, Belgium, Italy, and the United Kingdom. We are exposed to fluctuating exchange rates of
foreign currencies including the Euro, British pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, and Indian rupee. Accordingly, our future results
could be harmed by a variety of factors associated with international sales and operations, including:
•adverse political and economic conditions, or changes to such conditions, in a specific region or country;
•trade protection measures, including tariffs and import/export controls, imposed by the United States and/or by other countries or regional authorities
such as Canada or the European Union;
•the impact on local and global economies of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union;
•changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the lack of ability to hedge certain foreign currencies;
•compliance with laws and regulations in many countries and any subsequent changes in such laws and regulations;
•geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war;
•changing data privacy regulations and customer requirements to locate data centers in certain jurisdictions;
•evolving restrictions on cross-border investment, including recent enhancements to the oversight by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the
United States pursuant to the Foreign Investment Risk Preview Modernization Act;
•changes in applicable tax laws;
•difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations in many countries;
•longer payment cycles of foreign customers and timing of collections in foreign jurisdictions; and
•less effective protection of intellectual property outside the United States.
If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be harmed.
To execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. If any of our key employees were to leave, we could face substantial
difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience.
Although we have arrangements with some of our executive officers designed to promote retention, our employment relationships are generally at-will and
we have had key employees leave in the past. We cannot assure you that one or more key employees will not leave in the future. In particular, we compete
with many other companies for

California consumers with certain rights as data subjects. Several other U.S. states have proposed data privacy laws that impose similar but non-identical
obligations. In addition, some states have passed laws imposing increased data security and breach notification obligations on companies operating in the
U.S. In the EU, the European General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which went into effect in May 2018, imposes privacy and data security
compliance obligations and significant penalties for noncompliance. The GDPR presents numerous privacy-related changes for companies operating in the
EU, including rights guaranteed to data subjects, requirements for data portability for EU consumers, data breach notification requirements and significant
fines for noncompliance. In GDPR enforcement matters, companies have faced fines for violations of certain provisions. Fines can reach as high as 4% of a
company’s annual total revenue, potentially including the revenue of a company’s international affiliates. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the
European Union issued a decision that invalidates the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, a mechanism that companies had previously relied on to transfer
information between the EU and U.S., on the basis that such transfer mechanism does not comply with the level of protection required under the GDPR.
There is also an increase in regulation of biometric data globally, which may include voiceprints. In addition, we are subject to laws relating specifically to
personal health information, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (""HIPAA"") and the Health Information Technology
for Economic and Clinical Health (""HITECH"") Act.
Changes in these data privacy and protection laws and regulations and inconsistencies in the standards that apply to our business in different jurisdictions
may impose significant compliance costs, reduce the efficiency of our operations, expose us to enforcement risks, and materially adversely affect our
ability to market and sell our products and solutions.  Any alleged or actual failure by us, our customers, suppliers or other parties with whom we do
business to comply with federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could cause our customers to lose confidence
in our solutions; harm our reputation; expose us to litigation, regulatory investigations and to resulting liabilities including reimbursement of customer
costs, damages penalties or fines imposed by regulatory agencies, and require us to incur significant expenses for remediation.
We are also subject to a variety of anticorruption laws in respect of our international operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K.
Bribery Act and the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, and regulations issued by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S.
Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and various other foreign governmental agencies.  We
cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which
existing laws might be administered or interpreted. Actual or alleged violations of these laws and regulations could lead to enforcement actions and
financial penalties that could result in substantial costs.
Many of our customers are subject to various federal and state laws concerning their submission of claims for reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and
other federal and state government-sponsored health care programs. Such laws include the federal False Claims Act (the “False Claims Act”), the federal
anti-kickback statute, state false claims acts and anti-kickback statutes in most states, the federal “Stark Law” and related state laws. In particular, the False
Claims Act prohibits knowingly submitting, conspiring to submit, or causing to be submitted, false claims, records, or statements to the federal
government, or knowingly and improperly failing to return overpayments, in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs and can be
used as a vehicle to enforce each of these other laws. Claims under federal and state false claims acts can be brought by the government or by private
individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or “whistleblower” suit. If there is an adverse decision against us or our customers under these
laws relating to use of our products or solutions, we may be required to pay damages, significant fines and/or other monetary penalties, and our ability to
market and sell such products or solutions to customers may be materially adversely impacted.
Interruptions or delays in our services, including from data center hosting facilities, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.
Because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of third-party hardware and software, our services may have errors or defects that could result
in unanticipated downtime for our customers and harm to our reputation and our business. We have from time to time, found defects in our services, and
new errors in our services may be detected in the future. In addition, we currently serve our customers from data center hosting facilities we directly
manage and from third party public cloud facilities. Any damage to, or failure of, the systems that serve our customers in whole or in part could result in
interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay service-level agreement penalties, cause
customers to terminate their on-demand services, and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers.
We may be unable to fully capture the expected value from strategic transactions.
As part of our business strategy, we have in the past acquired and divested, and expect to continue to acquire and may divest, other businesses and
technologies. We also expect to from time to time pursue other strategic transactions including divestitures, joint ventures, minority stakes and strategic
alliances. Our acquisitions and divestitures have required substantial integration and

management efforts, and we expect future acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions to require similar efforts. Successfully realizing the
benefits of acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions involves a number of risks, including:
•difficulty in transitioning and integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;
•difficulty in separating the operations, personnel and systems of divested businesses:
•potential negative impact on our profitability as a result of losses that may result from a divestiture, including the loss of sales and operating income
or decrease in cash flows;
•retained exposure on financial guarantee leases, real estate and other contractual, employment, pension and severance obligations of divested
business, and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer;
•potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;
•difficulty in incorporating acquired products and technologies into our products and technologies;
•potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development;
•unanticipated expenses and delays in completing acquired development projects and technology integration and upgrades;
•challenges associated with managing additional, geographically remote businesses;
•impairment of relationships with partners and customers;
•assumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies;
•the accuracy of revenue and bookings projections of acquired companies;
•customers delaying purchases of our products pending resolution of product integration between our existing and our newly acquired products;
•entering markets or types of businesses in which we have limited experience; and
•potential loss of key employees of the acquired business or loss of key employees of a divested business.
As a result of these and other risks, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions. Any
failure to achieve these benefits or failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or disaggregate divested businesses and
technologies could seriously harm our business.
We may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the spin-off of our Automotive business segment.
We entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with Cerence to govern the spin-off and the relationship between the
two companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and
Cerence. For example, in the Tax Matters Agreement, dated September 30, 2019, between Nuance and Cerence, Cerence agreed to indemnify Nuance for
resulting taxes and related expenses if, as a result of any of Cerence’s breach of certain of its representations or covenants, the spin-off and certain related
reorganization transactions are determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain or loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The indemnity rights we have against Cerence under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us, for example if
our losses exceed our indemnity rights or if Cerence did not have the financial resources to meet its indemnity obligations. In addition, our indemnity
obligations to Cerence may be significant, and these risks could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Charges to earnings as a result of our acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results in the foreseeable future, which could have a material
and adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.
Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we record the market value of our common stock and other forms of consideration
issued in connection with an acquisition as the cost of acquiring the company or business. We allocate that cost to the individual assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, including various identifiable intangible assets such as acquired technology, acquired trade names and acquired customer relationships,
based on their respective fair values. We base our estimates of fair value upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain.
After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows:
•costs incurred to integrate the operations of businesses we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeployment or
relocation expenses;
•impairment of goodwill or intangible assets;
•amortization of intangible assets acquired;
•a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired;

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Technology
Third parties have claimed and may claim in the future that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could be exposed to significant
litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products if such claims are successful.
From time to time, we are subject to claims and legal actions alleging that we or our customers may be infringing or contributing to the infringement of the
intellectual property rights of others. We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technologies and products. If
it appears necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses for these intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses from some or
all claimants, the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us, and we may not be able to resolve disputes without litigation. Any litigation
regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business
operations. Intellectual property disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on
unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or licensing certain of our products, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which
we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments to our customers. Any of these could seriously harm our business.
Unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Our success and competitive position depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights protecting our products and
services. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to
establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or discover aspects of our products or to
obtain, license, sell or otherwise use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we may not be
able to protect our technology from unauthorized use. Additionally, our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially the
same or superior to our technologies and that do not infringe our rights. In these cases, we would be unable to prevent our competitors from selling or
licensing these similar or superior technologies. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as
the laws of the United States. Although the source code for our proprietary software is protected both as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work, litigation
may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of
others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Litigation, regardless of the outcome, can be very expensive and can divert management
efforts.
Our software products may have bugs, which could result in delayed or lost revenue and bookings, expensive correction, liability to our customers and
claims against us.
Complex software products such as ours may contain errors, defects or bugs. Defects in the solutions or products that we develop and sell to our customers
could require expensive corrections and result in delayed or lost revenue and bookings, adverse customer reaction and negative publicity about us or our
products and services. Customers who are not satisfied with any of our products may also bring claims against us for damages, which, even if unsuccessful,
would likely be time-consuming to defend, and could result in costly litigation and payment of damages. Such claims could harm our reputation, financial
results and competitive position.
Risks Related to our Indebtedness, Investments and Common Stock
Our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.
Our debt agreements contain, and any of our other future debt agreements or arrangements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to
operate our business, including restrictions on our ability to:
•incur additional debt or issue guarantees;
•create liens;
•make certain investments;
•enter into transactions with our affiliates;
•sell certain assets;
•repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments;
•declare or pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders; and
•merge or consolidate with any entity.
Our ability to comply with these limitations is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our
control, including prevailing economic conditions. As a result of these limitations, our ability to respond
15","The risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:"
13,"Table of Contents
Corporate assets and liabilities are allocated to each reporting unit based on the reporting unit’s revenue, total operating expenses or operating income as a
percentage of the consolidated amounts. Corporate debt and other financial liabilities that are not directly attributable to the reporting unit's operations and
would not be transferred to hypothetical purchasers of the reporting units are excluded from a reporting unit's carrying amount.
The fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. For the income approach,
fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future after-tax cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. We use our
internal forecasts to estimate future after-tax cash flows and estimate the long-term growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook
for each reporting unit. Actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts. We derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and
analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the weighted average cost of capital. We adjust the discount rates for the
risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. For the market approach, we use a valuation technique
in which values are derived based on valuation multiples of comparable publicly traded companies. We assess each valuation methodology based upon the
relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation and weight the methodologies appropriately.
Intangible Assets and long-lived Asset groups
Long-lived assets with definite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a specific asset
or asset group may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of long-lived assets with definite lives at the asset group level. Asset groups are
determined based upon the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the
asset group is also a reporting unit, goodwill assigned to the reporting unit is also included in the carrying amount of the asset group. For the purpose of the
recoverability test, we compare the total undiscounted future cash flows from the use and disposition of the assets with its net carrying amount. When the
carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the asset group is deemed to be impaired. The amount of the impairment loss
represents the excess of the asset or asset group’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is generally determined based upon the present value
of estimated future pre-tax cash flows that a market participant would expect from use and disposition of the long-lived asset or asset group. See Note 6 for
the impairment charges recorded in fiscal year 2018.
Income Taxes
Deferred Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net
operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not after consideration of all available evidence. As the
income tax returns are not due and filed until after the completion of our annual financial reporting requirements, the amounts recorded for the current
period reflect estimates for the tax-based activity for the period. In addition, estimates are often required with respect to, among other things, the
appropriate state and foreign income tax rates to use, the potential utilization of operating loss carry-forwards and valuation allowances required, if any, for
tax assets that may not be realizable in the future. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions, and are subject to change given the
political and economic climate. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates
currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions.
Any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to
change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate.
We have historically estimated the future tax consequence of certain items, including bad debts, inventory valuation, and accruals that cannot be deducted
for income tax purposes until such expenses are paid or the related assets are disposed. We believe the procedures and estimates used in our accounting for
income taxes are reasonable and in accordance with established tax law. The income tax estimates used have not resulted in material adjustments to income
tax expense in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to the actual filed tax return amounts.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. With respect to earnings expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, we do not accrue tax for the
repatriation of such foreign earnings.
Valuation Allowance
We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of
the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for a

valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. The weight given to
the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. If positive evidence regarding
projected future taxable income, exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences, existed it would be difficult for it to outweigh objective negative
evidence of recent financial reporting losses. Generally, cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to
overcome in determining that a valuation allowance is not needed.
As of September 30, 2020, we have $230.3 million of valuation allowances recorded against all U.S. deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax
assets. If we are subsequently able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which the remaining valuation allowance has been established,
then we may be required to recognize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of the valuation allowance which could result in a material benefit to
our results of operations in the period in which the benefit is determined.
Uncertain Tax Positions
We operate in multiple jurisdictions through wholly-owned subsidiaries and our global structure is complex. The estimates of our uncertain tax positions
involve judgments and assessment of the potential tax implications related to legal entity restructuring, credits, intercompany transfer and acquisition or
divestiture. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by
the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
Our tax positions are subject to audit by taxing authorities across multiple global jurisdictions and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years.
Tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, accordingly, the ultimate outcome with respect to taxes we may owe may differ from the
amounts recognized.

ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED
See Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of certain issued accounting standards that have not been adopted and

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices which could affect operating results,
financial position and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when
appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
Exchange Rate Sensitivity
We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Any foreign currency transaction, defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other
than the local functional currency, will be reported in the functional currency at the applicable exchange rate in effect at the time of the transaction. A
change in the value of the functional currency compared to the foreign currency of the transaction will have either a positive or negative impact on our
financial position and results of operations.
Assets and liabilities of our foreign entities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense
items are translated at average rates for the applicable period. Therefore, the change in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies will have
either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. Historically, our primary exposure has related to transactions
denominated in the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Indian rupee.
Periodically, we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against foreign exchange rate fluctuations. As of September 30, 2020, we had not
designated any contracts as fair value or cash flow hedges. The contracts generally have a maturity of less than 90 days. As of September 30, 2020, the
notional contract amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts was $40.7 million.
Interest Rate Sensitivity
We are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.

Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases in fiscal 2020 due to the
adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, ""Leases"" (""ASC 842"").
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Nuance Communications, Inc.’s (the “Company’s”) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the
“COSO criteria”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30,
2020 based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated
balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss),
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated
November 19, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded against goodwill in the period in which the amount is determined. Any adjustment identified
subsequent to the measurement period is included in operating results in the period in which the amount is determined.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but rather the carrying amounts of these assets are assessed for impairment at least annually or
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment
annually on July 1, the first day of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Goodwill impairment, if any, is determined by comparing the reporting unit's fair
value to its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, up to
the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. There was no goodwill impairment for fiscal year 2020. See Note 6 for the impairment charges
recorded in fiscal year 2018.
For the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, all goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units. A reporting
unit represents an operating segment or a component within an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly
reviewed by segment management for performance assessment and resource allocation. Components of similar economic characteristics are aggregated
into one reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment assessment. Reporting units are identified annually and re-assessed periodically for recent
acquisitions or any changes in segment reporting structure.
Corporate assets and liabilities are allocated to each reporting unit based on the reporting unit’ revenue, total operating expenses or operating income as a
percentage of the consolidated amounts. Corporate debt and other financial liabilities that are not directly attributable to the reporting unit's operations and
would not be transferred to hypothetical purchasers of the reporting units are excluded from a reporting unit's carrying amount.
The fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach, where the income approach
is weighted 50% and the market approach 50%. For the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future after-tax
cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future after-tax cash flows and estimate the long-term
growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Actual results may differ from those assumed in our
forecasts. We derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to
estimate the weighted average cost of capital. We adjust the discount rates for the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our
internally developed forecasts. For the market approach, we use a valuation technique in which values are derived based on valuation multiples of
comparable publicly traded companies. We assess each valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform
the valuation and weight the methodologies appropriately.
Long-Lived Assets with Definite Lives
Our long-lived assets consist principally of technology, customer relationships, internally developed software, land, and building and equipment. Customer
relationships are amortized over their estimated economic lives based on the pattern of economic benefits expected to be generated from the use of the
asset. Other definite-lived assets are amortized over their estimated economic lives using the straight-line method. The remaining useful lives of long-lived
assets are re-assessed periodically for any events and circumstances that may change the future cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived
asset or asset group.
Internally developed software consists of capitalized costs incurred during the application development stage, which include costs related design of the
software configuration and interfaces, coding, installation and testing. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post-implementation stage
are expensed as incurred. Internally developed software is amortized over the estimated useful life, commencing on the date when the asset is ready for its
intended use. Land, building and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are depreciated
over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated useful life. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. Repair and maintenance
costs are expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of sold or retired assets are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss
is included in the results of operations for the period.
Long-lived assets with definite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a specific asset
or asset group may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of long-lived assets with definite lives at the asset group level. Asset groups are
determined based upon the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely

Foreign currency translation adjustment $ (110,110) $ (124,608)
Net unrealized losses on post-retirement benefits (7,873) (8,296)
Unrealized gain (loss) on marketable securities 65 131
Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ (117,918) $ (132,773)
No income tax provisions or benefits are recorded for foreign currency translation adjustment as the undistributed earnings in our foreign subsidiaries are
expected to be indefinitely reinvested.
Concentration of Risk
Financial instruments that are potentially subject to significant concentrations of credit risk principally consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable
securities and trade accounts receivable. We place our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities with financial institutions with high credit
ratings. As part of our cash and investment management processes, we perform periodic evaluations of the credit standing of the financial institutions with
whom we maintain deposits, and have not recorded any credit losses to-date. For trade accounts receivable, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our
customers’ financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended when deemed appropriate. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our net
accounts receivable balance at September 30, 2020 and 2019 or 10% of our revenue for fiscal years 2020, 2019 or 2018.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of a foreign subsidiary is generally the local currency. We translate the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars
using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the reporting period for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation
gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders’ equity. We record net foreign exchange transaction gains and
losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to the functional currency within in other expense, net. Foreign currency transaction gains
(losses)for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $1.3 million, $1.1 million and $(1.2) million, respectively.
Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
We use forward currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency for certain transactions. In order for instruments to
be designated as hedges, specific criteria must be met, including (i) formal documentation must exist for both the hedging relationship and our risk
management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedging activities, (ii) at the inception and on an ongoing basis, the hedging relationship is
expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value attributed to the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated, and (iii) an
assessment of effectiveness is required whenever financial statements or earnings are reported.
The effective portion of changes in the fair values of contracts designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss until the hedged item effects earnings. Once the underlying forecasted transaction is realized, the changes of fair vales of instruments
designated as hedges reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the statement of operations, in the appropriate income statement line items.
Any ineffective portion of the instruments designated as cash flow hedges is recognized in current earnings. We report cash flows arising from derivative
financial instruments designated as fair value or cash flow hedges consistent with the classification of the cash flows from the underlying hedged items that
these derivatives are hedging.
No forward exchange contracts are designated as hedges for fiscal years 2020, 2019, or 2018. Changes in the fair values of the forward currency exchange
contracts are recorded within other expense, net. Cash flows related to investments and settlements of forward currency exchange contracts are included
within cash flows from investing activities.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation primarily consists of restricted stock units with service, and market or performance conditions. Equity awards are measured at
the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize stock compensation expense

the Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at either (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.50% or 1.75%, or (ii) the alternative base rate plus an
applicable margin of 0.50% or 0.75%. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by substantially all our assets. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains
customary affirmative and negative covenants and conditions to borrowing, as well as customary events of default. At any time that there are any
outstanding borrowings (excluding up to $25,000,000 of issued and undrawn Letters of Credit) under the Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to
maintain a Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) not exceeding 4.00 to 1.00. We were in
compliance with all the debt covenants as of September 30, 2020.
On March 24, 2020, we borrowed $230.0 million under our revolving credit facility at an effective interest rate of 2.68% per annum, which was fully repaid
on June 26, 2020. As of September 30, 2020, after taking into account the outstanding letters of credit of $2.4 million, we had $240.1 million available for
borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility.
11. Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
Derivatives not Designated as Hedges
Forward Currency Contracts
We have operations in a number of international locations, including certain developing markets where currency exchange rates can be volatile. We utilize
foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates so that our exposure to foreign
currencies will be mitigated or offset by the gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts. Generally, we enter into such contracts for less than
90 days and have no cash requirements until maturity. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, we had outstanding contracts with a total notional value of
$40.7 million and $189.6 million, respectively.
We did not designate any forward contracts as hedging instruments for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018. Therefore, changes in fair value of foreign
currency forward contracts were recognized within other expense, net in our consolidated statements of operations. The cash flows related to the settlement
of forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments are included in cash flows from investing activities within our consolidated statement of cash
flows.
A summary of our derivative instruments is as follows (dollars in thousands):

12. Fair Value Measures
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. Valuation techniques must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. When
determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous
market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk,
transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.
The determination of the applicable level within the hierarchy of a particular financial asset or liability depends on the lowest level of inputs that are
significant to the fair value measurement as of the measurement date as follows:
•Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described as Level 1.
•Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supportable by little or no market activities and are based on significant assumptions and estimates.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2020 and 2019 consisted of (dollars in thousands):

1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The ESPP, as amended and restated on January 27, 2015, authorizes the issuance of a maximum of 20,000,000 shares of common stock in semi-annual
offerings to employees at a price equal to the lower of 85% of the closing price on the applicable offering

purchase plan is recognized for the fair value benefit accorded to participating employees. At September 30, 2020, we have reserved 3.6 million shares for
future issuance. A summary of the weighted-average grant-date fair value, shares issued, and total stock-based compensation expense recognized related to
the ESPP are as follows:

18. Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation and Other Claims
Similar to many companies in the software industry, we are involved in a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations and proceedings that arise from
time to time relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to contracts, intellectual property,
employment, benefits and securities matters. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate contingent liabilities associated with these matters in accordance with
ASC 450 ""Contingencies"". If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we
accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgments are required for the determination of probability and the range of the outcomes, and the
estimates are based only on the information available at the time. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in claims, legal proceedings, and in estimating
the losses that may arise, actual outcomes may differ from our estimates. Contingencies deemed not probable or for which losses were not estimable in one
period may become probable, or losses may become estimable in later periods which may have a material impact on our results of operations and financial
position. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our
estimates. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, accrued losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements, and we do not expect any
pending matter to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Guarantees and Other
We include indemnification provisions in the contracts we enter into with customers and business partners. Generally, these provisions require us to defend
claims arising out of our products’ infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, breach of contractual obligations and/or unlawful or otherwise
culpable conduct. The indemnity obligations generally cover damages, costs and attorneys’ fees arising out of such claims. In most, but not all cases, our
total liability under such provisions is limited to either the value of the contract or a specified, agreed upon amount. In some cases, our total liability under
such provisions is unlimited. In many, but not all cases, the term of the indemnity provision is perpetual. While the maximum potential amount of future
payments we could be required to make under all the indemnification provisions is unlimited, we believe the estimated fair value of these provisions is
minimal due to the low frequency with which these provisions have been triggered.
We indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, which provides among other things, indemnification to directors
and officers for expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and settlement amounts incurred by such persons in their capacity as a director or officer of the
company, regardless of whether the individual is serving in any such capacity at the time the liability or expense is incurred. Additionally, in connection
with certain acquisitions, we agreed to indemnify the former

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020, utilizing the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on the results
of this assessment, management (including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer) has concluded that, as of September 30, 2020, our
internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The attestation report concerning the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020 issued by BDO USA, LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
There have been no material changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
